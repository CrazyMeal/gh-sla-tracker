Operations related to artifacts, cache, job steps and logs also had significantly increased latency. At peak, 67% of workflow jobs queued during that timeframe were impacted, and the median latency for impacted operations increased by up to 35x.This was caused by a significant change in load pattern on Actions Cache-related operations, leading to a saturated shared resource on the backend. The impact was mitigated by mitigating the new load pattern.To reduce the likelihood of a recurrence, we are improving rate-limiting measures in this area to ensure a more consistent experience for all customers.  We are also evaluating changes to reduce the scope of impact.",

We mitigated the incident by replacing the expired certificate and restarting impacted services. Once those services were restarted we saw a full recovery.We have updated our alerting to cover the expired certificate and are performing an audit of other certificates in this area to ensure they also have the proper alerting and automation before expiration.

A change to the notifications settings access path introduced additional load to the settings system, degrading its response times. This impacted both requests to web notifications (with p99 response times as high as 1.5s, while lower percentiles remained stable) and notification deliveries, which reached a peak delay of 24 minutes on average. System capacity was increased around 15:10 UTC and the problematic change was fully reverted soon after that, restoring the latency of web notifications and increasing notification delivery throughput, decreasing the delay in notification deliveries. The notification queue was fully emptied around 17:40 UTC.We are working to adjust capacity in the affected systems and to improve the time needed to address these capacity issues.",

This impacted all customers queueing workflows from the UI for most of the impact window. The issue was caused by a faulty code change in the UI, which was promptly reverted once the impact was identified. Detection was delayed due to an alerting gap for UI breaks in this area when all underlying APIs are still healthy. We are implementing enhanced alerting and additional automated tests to prevent similar regressions and reduce detection time in the future.",

There were approximately 100 requests during the incident that would have failed the download.

Git operations were functional throughout this period.This was caused by feature flagged changes impacting organization membership.

This partition failure resulted in users from affected organizations, whose license usage information was stored on this partition, being unable to access SSO during the aforementioned window. A successful SSO requires an available license for the user who is accessing a GitHub Enterprise Cloud Organization backed by SSO.The failing partition was subsequently taken out of service, thereby mitigating the issue.

When the feature was partially rolled out it performed an excessive number of writes per request which caused excessive latency for writes from other API and Web endpoints and resulted in 5xx errors to customers. The issue was identified by our automatic alerting and reverted by turning down the percentage of traffic to the new feature, which led to recovery of the data cluster and services. We are working to improve the way we roll out new features like this and move the specific writes from this incident to a storage solution more suited to this type of activity. We have also optimized this particular feature to avoid its rollout from having future impact on other areas of the site. We are also investigating how we can even more quickly identify issues like this.",

On average, the error rate was 46% and peaked at 96% of requests to the service. XL and Intel runners recovered by 10:10 UTC, with the other types taking longer to recover.The degraded capacity was triggered by a scheduled event at 07:00 UTC that led to a permission failure on Mac runner hosts, blocking reimage operations.  The permission issue was resolved by 9:41 UTC, but the recovery of available runners took longer than expected due to a combination of backoff logic slowing backend operations and some hosts needing state resets.We deployed changes immediately following the incident to address the scheduled event and ensure that similar failures will not block critical operations in the future.

While many of the impacted instances self-recovered after mitigation efforts, approximately 2,000 codespaces remained stuck in a \"shutting down\" state while the team evaluated possible methods to recover unpushed data from the latest active session of affected codespaces. Unfortunately, recovery of that data was not possible. We unblocked shutdown of those codespaces, with all instances either shut down or available by 8:26 UTC on September 19.The disconnects were triggered by an exhaustion of resources in the network relay infrastructure in that region, but the lack of self-recovery was caused by an unhandled error impacting the local agent, which led to an unclean shutdown.We are improving the resilience of the local agent to disconnect events to ensure shutdown of codespaces is always clean without data loss.  We have also addressed the exhausted resources in the network relay and will be investing in improved detection and resilience to reduce the impact of similar events in the future.",

While this caused unauthenticated requests to be rejected by these endpoints, all authenticated requests were unaffected, and no protected endpoints were exposed.This resulted in 100% of requests to these endpoints failing at peak, representing less than 0.1% of GitHub’s overall request volume. On average, the error rate for these endpoints was less than 50% and peaked at 100% for about 26 hours over September 16th. API requests to the impacted endpoints were rejected with a 401 error code. This was due to a mismatch in authentication policies, for specific endpoints, during a system migration.The failure to detect the errors was the result of the issue occurring for a low percentage of traffic.We mitigated the incident by reverting the policy in question, and correcting the logic associated with the degraded endpoints. We are working to improve our test suite to further validate mismatches, and refining our monitors for proactive detection.",

This was due a partial deployment of a feature flag to a global rate limiter. The flag triggered behavior that unintentionally rate limited all requests, resulting in 100% of them returning 403 errors. The issue was resolved by reverting the feature flag which resulted in immediate recovery.The root cause of the incident was from an undetected edge case in our rate limiting logic. The flag was meant to scale down rate limiting for a subset of users, but unintentionally put our rate limiting configuration into an invalid state.To prevent this from happening again, we have addressed the bug with our rate limiting. We are also adding additional monitors to detect anomalies in our traffic patterns, which will allow us to identify similar issues during future deployments. Furthermore, we are exploring ways to test our rate limit scaling in our internal environment to enhance our pre-production validation process.",

We are performing a full reconciliation of the search index and customers can expect to see records being updated and content becoming searchable for all repos again between now and Sept 25.NOTE: Users who notice missing or outdated repositories in search results can force reindexing by starring or un-starring the repository. Other repository actions such as adding topics, or updating the repository description, will also result in reindexing. In general, changes to searchable artifacts in GitHub will also update their respective search index in near-real time.User impact has been mitigated with the exception of the 1.5% of repos that are missing from the search index. The change responsible for the search issue has been reverted, and full reconciliation of the search index is underway, expected to complete by September 23. We have added additional checks to our indexing model to ensure this failure does not happen again. We are also investigating faster repair alternatives.To avoid resource contention and possible further issues we are currently not repairing repositories or organizations individually at this time.

This was caused by connectivity issues in our East US region, which prevented runners from retrieving jobs and sending progress updates. As a result, capacity was significantly reduced, especially for busier configurations, leading to queuing and service interruptions. Approximately 8.05% of jobs on public standard Ubuntu24 runners and 3.4% of jobs on private standard Ubuntu24 runners did not start as expected.By 18:10 UTC, we had mitigated the issue by provisioning additional resources in the affected region and burning down the backlog of queued runner assignments. By the end of that day, we deployed changes to improve runner connectivity resilience and graceful degradation in similar situations.  We are also taking further steps to improve system resiliency by enhancing observability of network connection health with runners and improving load distribution and failover handling to help prevent similar issues in the future.",

The incident was triggered by intermittent connectivity issues between our load balancers and search hosts.

The query failures were mitigated at 15:30 UTC after throttling our search indexing pipeline to reduce load and stabilize retries.

During this time, a configuration change to improve our UI deployment system caused a surge in requests to a backend datastore. This change led to an unexpected spike in connection attempts to our datastore and saturated its connection backlog and resulted in intermittent failures to serve required UI content. This resulted in elevated error rates for frontend requests.The incident was mitigated by reverting the configuration, which restored normal service.Following mitigation, we are evaluating improvements to our alerting thresholds and exploring architectural changes to reduce load to this datastore and improve the resilience of our UI delivery pipeline.",

This was due to a sustained increase in unauthenticated repository traffic.We mitigated the incident by applying regional rate limiting, rolling back a service that was unable to scale with the additional traffic, and addressed a bug that impacted the caching of raw requests. Additionally, we horizontally scaled several dependencies of the service to appropriately handle the increase in traffic.We are working on improving our time to detection and have implemented controls to prevent similar incidents in future.",

At the peak of this incident (a 2 minute period around 07:00 UTC) error rates peaked at 11% and went down shortly after. Average web request load times rose to 1 second during this same time frame. After this period, traffic gradually recovered but error rate and latency remained slightly elevated until the end of the incident.This incident was triggered by a kernel bug that caused a crash of some of our load balancers during a scheduled process after a kernel upgrade. In order to mitigate the incident, we halted the roll out of our upgrades, and rolled back the impacted instances. We are working to make sure the kernel version is fully removed from our fleet. As a precaution, we temporarily paused the scheduled process to prevent any unintended use in the affected kernel. We also tuned our alerting so we can more quickly detect and mitigate future instances where we experience a sudden drop in load-balancing capacity.",

During the incident, 17% of workflow runs experienced cache download failures, resulting in a warning message in the logs and performance degradation. The disruption was caused by a network issue in our database systems that led to a database replica getting out of sync with the primary. We mitigated the incident by routing cache download url requests to bypass the out-of-sync replica until it was fully restored.To prevent this class of incidents, we are developing capability in our database system to more robustly bypass out-of-sync replicas. We are also implementing improved monitoring to help us detect similar issues more quickly going forward.",

Approximately 57% of codespaces were affected during this incident, during which some customers may have observed incomplete or delayed billing usage information in their dashboards and usage reports, and may not have received timely notifications about approaching usage or spending limits. The incident was caused by an increase in the number of jobs in our worker pool without a corresponding increase in capacity, resulting in a backlog of unprocessed Codespaces billing jobs. We mitigated the issue by scaling up worker capacity, allowing the backlog to clear and billing data to catch up. We started seeing recovery immediately at 17:40 UTC and were fully caught up by 19:04 UTC.To prevent recurrence, we are moving critical billing jobs into a dedicated worker pool monitored by the Codespaces team, and are reviewing alerting thresholds to ensure more rapid detection and mitigation of delays in the future.",

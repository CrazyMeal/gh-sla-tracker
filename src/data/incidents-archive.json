This was caused by network packet loss between runners in the West US region and one of GitHub’s edge sites. Approximately 1.5% of jobs on larger and standard hosted runners in the West US region were impacted, 0.28% of all Actions jobs during this period.<br /><br />By 17:11 UTC, all traffic was routed away from the affected edge site, mitigating the timeouts.

You can try again by re-requesting a review.” The remaining requests completed successfully.<br /><br />The degradation was caused by elevated response times in an internal, model-backed dependency, which led to request timeouts and backpressure in the review processing pipeline, resulting in sustained queue growth and failed review completion.<br /><br />We mitigated the issue by temporarily bypassing fix suggestions to reduce latency, increasing worker capacity to drain the backlog, and rolling out a model configuration change that reduced end-to-end latency. Queue depth and request success rates returned to normal and remained stable through peak traffic.<br /><br />Following the incident, we increased baseline worker capacity, added instrumentation for worker utilization and queue health, and are improving automatic load-shedding, fallback behavior, and alerting to reduce time to detection and mitigation for similar issues.",

We mitigated this by deleting the runner.<br /><br />The routing configuration is not something controlled externally. A manual override was done previously for internal testing, but left incorrect metadata for a large runner instance. An infrastructure migration caused this misconfigured runner to come online which started the incorrect assignments. We are removing the ability to manually override this configuration entirely, and are adding alerting to identify possible OS mismatches for hosted runner jobs.<br /><br />As a reminder, hosted runner VMs are secure and ephemeral, with every VM reimaged after every single job. All jobs impacted here were originally targeted at a GitHub-owned VM image and were run on a GitHub-owned VM image.",

All jobs successfully completed despite the delays. At peak impact, approximately 8% of workflow runs were affected.<br /><br />During this incident, some nodes received a spike in workflow events that led to queuing of event processing. Because runs are pinned to nodes, runs being processed by these nodes saw delays in starting or showing as completed. The team was alerted to this at 8:58 UTC. Impacted nodes were disabled from processing new jobs to allow queues to drain.<br /><br />We have increased overall processing capacity and are implementing safeguards to better balance load across all nodes when spikes occur. This is important to ensure our available capacity can always be fully utilized.",

The incident was triggered by a buildup of synchronization requests, resulting in elevated Redis key usage and high CPU consumption on the underlying Redis cluster.<br /><br />To mitigate further impact, we proactively paused all team synchronization requests between 3:00 pm UTC and 8:15 pm UTC, allowing us to stabilize the Redis cluster. Our engineering team also resolved the issue by flushing the affected Redis keys and queues, which promptly stopped runaway growth and restored service health. Additionally, we scaled up our infrastructure resources to improve our ability to process the high volume of synchronization requests. All pending team synchronizations were successfully processed following service restoration.<br /><br />We are working to strengthen the Team Synchronization service by implementing a killswitch, adding throttling to prevent excessive enqueueing of synchronization requests, and improving the scheduler to avoid duplicate job requests. Additionally, we’re investing in better observability to alert when job drops occur. These efforts are focused on preventing similar incidents and improving overall reliability going forward.",

As a result, customers were temporarily unable to request redeliveries for those delayed records.

This was caused by mismatching version dependencies for the released VS Code Codespaces extension.<br /><br />The connection issues were mitigated by releasing the VS Code Codespaces extension version 1.18.2 that addressed the issue. Users utilizing version 1.18.1 of the VS Code Codespaces extension are advised to upgrade to version >=1.18.2.<br /><br />We are improving our validation and release process for this extension to ensure functional issues like this are caught before release to customers and to reduce detection and mitigation times for extension issues like this in the future.",

These failures also impacted products that rely on Git operations.<br /><br />The root cause was an expired TLS certificate used for internal service-to-service communication. We mitigated the incident by replacing the expired certificate and restarting impacted services. Once those services were restarted we saw a full recovery.<br /><br />We have updated our alerting to cover the expired certificate and are performing an audit of other certificates in this area to ensure they also have the proper alerting and automation before expiration. In parallel, we are accelerating efforts to eliminate our remaining manually managed certificates, ensuring all service-to-service communication is fully automated and aligned with modern security practices.",

A change to the notifications settings access path introduced additional load to the settings system, degrading its response times. This impacted both requests to web notifications (with p99 response times as high as 1.5s, while lower percentiles remained stable) and notification deliveries, which reached a peak delay of 24 minutes on average. System capacity was increased around 15:10 UTC and the problematic change was fully reverted soon after that, restoring the latency of web notifications and increasing notification delivery throughput, decreasing the delay in notification deliveries. The notification queue was fully emptied around 17:40 UTC.<br /><br />We are working to adjust capacity in the affected systems and to improve the time needed to address these capacity issues.",

The majority of impact was mitigated by 18:44, with a small tail of organizations taking longer to recover.<br /><br />The impact was caused by the same database infrastructure issue that caused similar larger hosted runner performance degradation on October 23rd, 2025.  In this case, it was triggered by a brief infrastructure event in this incident rather than a database change.<br /><br />Through this incident, we identified and implemented a better solution for both prevention and faster mitigation. In addition to this, a durable solution for the underlying database issue is rolling out soon.",

This impacted all customers queueing workflows from the UI for most of the impact window. The issue was caused by a faulty code change in the UI, which was promptly reverted once the impact was identified. Detection was delayed due to an alerting gap for UI breaks in this area when all underlying APIs are still healthy. We are implementing enhanced alerting and additional automated tests to prevent similar regressions and reduce detection time in the future.",

On average the Codespace connection error rate was 90% and peaked at 100% across all regions throughout the incident period.<br />- GitHub Actions larger hosted runners experienced degraded performance, with 0.5% of overall workflow runs and 9.8% of larger hosted runner jobs failing or not starting within 5 minutes.  These recovered by 20:40 UTC.<br />- The GitHub Enterprise Importer service was degraded, with some users experiencing migration failures during git push operations and most users experiencing delayed migration processing.<br />- Initiation of new trials for GitHub Enterprise Cloud with Data Residency were also delayed during this time.<br />- Copilot Metrics via the API could not access the downloadable link during this time. There were approximately 100 requests during the incident that would have failed the download. Recovery began around 20:25 UTC.<br /><br />We were able to apply a number of mitigations to reduce impact over the course of the incident, but we did not achieve 100% recovery until our service provider’s incident was resolved.<br /><br />We are working to reduce critical path dependencies on the service provider and gracefully degrade experiences where possible so that we are more resilient to future dependency outages.",

The impact was limited to logged in users accessing repositories in organizations with more than 200,000 members. Forks of repositories from affected large organizations were also impacted. Git operations were functional throughout this period.<br /><br />This was caused by feature flagged changes impacting organization membership. The changes caused unintended timeouts for organization membership count evaluations which led to repository landing pages not loading.<br /><br />The flag was turned off and a fix addressing the timeouts was deployed, including additional optimizations to better support organizations of this size.

This partition failure resulted in users from affected organizations, whose license usage information was stored on this partition, being unable to access SSO during the aforementioned window.

During this time, 2.11% workflow runs failed to start within 5 minutes, with an average delay of 8.2 minutes. The root cause was increased latency on a node in one of our Redis clusters, triggered by resource contention after a patching event became stuck. <br /><br />Recovery began once the patching process was unstuck and normal connectivity to the Redis cluster was restored at 11:45 UTC, but it took until 12:20 UTC to clear the backlog of queued work. We are implementing safeguards to prevent this failure mode and enhancing our monitoring to detect and address problems like this more quickly in the future.",

On average, the error rate for codespace creation was 39.5% and peaked at 71% of requests to the service during the incident window. Resume operations averaged 23.4% error rate with a peak of 46%. This was due to a cascading failure triggered by an outage in a 3rd-party dependency required to build devcontainer images.<br /><br />The impact was mitigated when the 3rd-party dependency recovered.<br /><br />We are investigating opportunities to make this dependency not a critical path for our container build process and working to improve our monitoring and alerting systems to reduce our time to detection of issues like this one in the future.",

Network traffic traversing this device experienced significant packet loss.<br /><br />Authenticated users of the github.com UI experienced increased latency during the first 5 minutes of the incident. API users experienced up to 7.3% error rates, after which it stabilized to about 0.05% until mitigated. Actions service experienced 24% of runs being delayed for an average of 13 minutes. Large File Storage (LFS) requests experienced minimally increased error rate, with 0.038% of requests erroring.<br /><br />To prevent similar issues, we are enhancing the validation process for device repairs of this category.",

When the feature was partially rolled out it performed an excessive number of writes per request which caused excessive latency for writes from other API and Web endpoints and resulted in 5xx errors to customers. <br /><br />The issue was identified by our automatic alerting and reverted by turning down the percentage of traffic to the new feature, which led to recovery of the data cluster and services. <br /><br />We are working to improve the way we roll out new features like this and move the specific writes from this incident to a storage solution more suited to this type of activity. We have also optimized this particular feature to avoid its rollout from having future impact on other areas of the site.

XL and Intel runners recovered by 10:10 UTC, with the other types taking longer to recover.<br /><br />The degraded capacity was triggered by a scheduled event at 07:00 UTC that led to a permission failure on Mac runner hosts, blocking reimage operations.  The permission issue was resolved by 9:41 UTC, but the recovery of available runners took longer than expected due to a combination of backoff logic slowing backend operations and some hosts needing state resets.<br /><br />We deployed changes immediately following the incident to address the scheduled event and ensure that similar failures will not block critical operations in the future.

Codespace creations and resumes were failed over to another region at 15:01 UTC. While many of the impacted instances self-recovered after mitigation efforts, approximately 2,000 codespaces remained stuck in a \"shutting down\" state while the team evaluated possible methods to recover unpushed data from the latest active session of affected codespaces. Unfortunately, recovery of that data was not possible. We unblocked shutdown of those codespaces, with all instances either shut down or available by 8:26 UTC on September 19.<br /><br />The disconnects were triggered by an exhaustion of resources in the network relay infrastructure in that region, but the lack of self-recovery was caused by an unhandled error impacting the local agent, which led to an unclean shutdown.<br /><br />We are improving the resilience of the local agent to disconnect events to ensure shutdown of codespaces is always clean without data loss.  We have also addressed the exhausted resources in the network relay and will be investing in improved detection and resilience to reduce the impact of similar events in the future.",

On average, the error rate for these endpoints was less than 50% and peaked at 100% for about 26 hours over September 16th. API requests to the impacted endpoints were rejected with a 401 error code. This was due to a mismatch in authentication policies, for specific endpoints, during a system migration.<br /><br />The failure to detect the errors was the result of the issue occurring for a low percentage of traffic.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by reverting the policy in question, and correcting the logic associated with the degraded endpoints.

On average, the error rate for these endpoints was less than 50% and peaked at 100% for about 26 hours over September 16th. API requests to the impacted endpoints were rejected with a 401 error code. This was due to a mismatch in authentication policies, for specific endpoints, during a system migration.<br /><br />The failure to detect the errors was the result of the issue occurring for a low percentage of traffic.<br /><br />We mitigated the incident by reverting the policy in question, and correcting the logic associated with the degraded endpoints.

This was due a partial deployment of a feature flag to a global rate limiter. The flag triggered behavior that unintentionally rate limited all requests, resulting in 100% of them returning 403 errors. The issue was resolved by reverting the feature flag which resulted in immediate recovery.<br /><br />The root cause of the incident was from an undetected edge case in our rate limiting logic. The flag was meant to scale down rate limiting for a subset of users, but unintentionally put our rate limiting configuration into an invalid state.<br /><br />To prevent this from happening again, we have addressed the bug with our rate limiting. We are also adding additional monitors to detect anomalies in our traffic patterns, which will allow us to identify similar issues during future deployments. Furthermore, we are exploring ways to test our rate limit scaling in our internal environment to enhance our pre-production validation process.<br />",

As a result, approximately 25% of repositories were temporarily missing from search results.<br /><br />By 12:45 UTC on Saturday, September 14, most missing repositories were restored from an earlier search index snapshot, and repositories updated between the snapshot and the restoration were reindexed. This backfill was completed at 21:25 UTC.<br /><br />After these repairs, about 98.5% of repositories were once again searchable. We are performing a full reconciliation of the search index and customers can expect to see records being updated and content becoming searchable for all repos again between now and Sept 25.<br /><br />NOTE: Users who notice missing or outdated repositories in search results can force reindexing by starring or un-starring the repository. Other repository actions such as adding topics, or updating the repository description, will also result in reindexing. In general, changes to searchable artifacts in GitHub will also update their respective search index in near-real time.<br /><br />User impact has been mitigated with the exception of the 1.5% of repos that are missing from the search index. The change responsible for the search issue has been reverted, and full reconciliation of the search index is underway, expected to complete by September 23. We have added additional checks to our indexing model to ensure this failure does not happen again. We are also investigating faster repair alternatives.<br /><br />To avoid resource contention and possible further issues we are currently not repairing repositories or organizations individually at this time.

During this time, avatar images appeared broken on github.com for affected users. On average, this impacted about 82% of users routed through one of our Middle East-based points-of-presence, which represents about 0.14% of global users.This was due to a configuration change within GitHub's edge infrastructure in the affected region, causing HTTP requests to fail. As a result, image requests returned HTTP 503 errors. The failure to detect the issues was the result of an alerting threshold set too low.We mitigated the incident by removing the affected site from service, which restored avatar serving for impacted users.To prevent this from recurring, we have tuned configuration defaults for graceful degradation. We also added new health checks to automatically shift traffic from impacted sites. We are updating our monitoring to prevent undetected errors like this in the future.",

Approximately 2% of all non-Copilot Web and REST API traffic requests failed.This incident occurred after we initiated a production database migration to drop a column from a table backing copilot functionality. While the column was no longer in direct use, our ORM continued to reference the dropped column. This led to a large number of 5xx responses and was similar to the incident on August 5th. At 21:15 UTC, we applied a fix to the production schema and by 21:17 UTC, all services had fully recovered.While repairs were in progress to avoid this situation, they were not completed quickly enough to prevent a second incident. We have now implemented a temporary block for all drop column operations as an immediate solution while we add more safeguards to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future. We are also implementing graceful degradation so that Copilot issues will not impact other features of our product.",

This was caused by connectivity issues in our East US region, which prevented runners from retrieving jobs and sending progress updates. As a result, capacity was significantly reduced, especially for busier configurations, leading to queuing and service interruptions. Approximately 8.05% of jobs on public standard Ubuntu24 runners and 3.4% of jobs on private standard Ubuntu24 runners did not start as expected.By 18:10 UTC, we had mitigated the issue by provisioning additional resources in the affected region and burning down the backlog of queued runner assignments. By the end of that day, we deployed changes to improve runner connectivity resilience and graceful degradation in similar situations.  We are also taking further steps to improve system resiliency by enhancing observability of network connection health with runners and improving load distribution and failover handling to help prevent similar issues in the future.",

The incident was triggered by intermittent connectivity issues between our load balancers and search hosts. While retry logic initially masked these problems, retry queues eventually overwhelmed the load balancers, causing failure. The query failures were mitigated at 15:30 UTC after throttling our search indexing pipeline to reduce load and stabilize retries.  The connectivity failures were resolved at 17:14 UTC after the automated reboot of a search host, causing the rest of the system to recover.  We have improved internal monitors and playbooks, and tuned our search cluster load balancer to further mitigate the recurrence of this failure mode. We continue to invest in resolving the underlying connectivity issues.",

This was due to a sustained increase in unauthenticated repository traffic.We mitigated the incident by applying regional rate limiting, rolling back a service that was unable to scale with the additional traffic, and addressed a bug that impacted the caching of raw requests. Additionally, we horizontally scaled several dependencies of the service to appropriately handle the increase in traffic.We are working on improving our time to detection and have implemented controls to prevent similar incidents in future.",

This was due to a sustained increase in unauthenticated repository traffic.We mitigated the incident by applying regional rate limiting, rolling back a service that was unable to scale with the additional traffic, and addressed a bug that impacted the caching of raw requests. Additionally, we horizontally scaled several dependencies of the service to appropriately handle the increase in traffic.We are working on improving our time to detection and have implemented controls to prevent similar incidents in future.",

Other hosted runners, self-hosted runners, and public repo workflows were unaffected.To mitigate the issue, additional worker capacity was added from a different datacenter region at 15:35 UTC and further increased at 16:00 UTC.

After this period, traffic gradually recovered but error rate and latency remained slightly elevated until the end of the incident.This incident was triggered by a kernel bug that caused a crash of some of our load balancers during a scheduled process after a kernel upgrade. In order to mitigate the incident, we halted the roll out of our upgrades, and rolled back the impacted instances. We are working to make sure the kernel version is fully removed from our fleet. As a precaution, we temporarily paused the scheduled process to prevent any unintended use in the affected kernel. We also tuned our alerting so we can more quickly detect and mitigate future instances where we experience a sudden drop in load-balancing capacity.",

The disruption was caused by a network issue in our database systems that led to a database replica getting out of sync with the primary.

Approximately 57% of codespaces were affected during this incident, during which some customers may have observed incomplete or delayed billing usage information in their dashboards and usage reports, and may not have received timely notifications about approaching usage or spending limits. The incident was caused by an increase in the number of jobs in our worker pool without a corresponding increase in capacity, resulting in a backlog of unprocessed Codespaces billing jobs. We mitigated the issue by scaling up worker capacity, allowing the backlog to clear and billing data to catch up. We started seeing recovery immediately at 17:40 UTC and were fully caught up by 19:04 UTC.To prevent recurrence, we are moving critical billing jobs into a dedicated worker pool monitored by the Codespaces team, and are reviewing alerting thresholds to ensure more rapid detection and mitigation of delays in the future.",

The impact extended beyond Actions itself - 60% of Copilot Coding Agent sessions were cancelled, and all Pages sites using branch-based builds failed to deploy (though Pages serving remained unaffected). The issue was caused by a spike in load between internal Actions services exposing a misconfiguration that caused throttling of requests in the critical path of run starts.

At 6:20 UTC on May 26, load increased on the code path in question and started to degrade a Copilot API because the caching for this endpoint and circuit breakers for high load were misconfigured.In addition, the traffic limiting meant to protect wider swaths of the GitHub API from queuing was not yet covering this endpoint, meaning it was able to overwhelm the capacity to serve traffic and cause request queuing.We were able to mitigate the incident by turning off the endpoint until the behavior could be reverted.We are already working on a quality of service strategy for API endpoints like this that will limit the impact of a broad incident and are rolling it out. We are also addressing the specific caching and circuit breaker misconfigurations for this endpoint, which would have reduced the time to mitigate this particular incident and the blast radius.",

Customers may have seen extended wait times for migrations to start or complete.This incident was initially observed as a slowdown in migration processing. During our investigation, we identified that a recent change aimed at improving API query performance caused an increase in load signals, which triggered migration throttling. As a result, the performance of migrations was negatively impacted, and overall migration duration increased. In parallel, we identified a race condition that caused a specific migration to be repeatedly re-queued, further straining system resources and contributing to a backlog of migration jobs, resulting in accumulated delays. No data was lost, and all migrations were ultimately processed successfully.We have reverted the feature flag associated with a query change and are working to improve system safeguards to help prevent similar race condition issues from occurring in the future.",

The incident was caused by queueing in serving systems due to a change in traffic patterns, specifically scraping activity targeting our API. We have adjusted limits and added flow control to systems in response to the changing traffic patterns to improve our ability to prevent future large queueing issues.

The Pull Request synchronization process has automatic retries and most delays were automatically resolved.

The issue stemmed from connectivity problems between the Actions services and certain nodes within one of our Redis clusters. The service began recovering once connectivity to the Redis cluster was restored at 13:41 UTC. These connectivity issues are typically not a concern because we can fail over to healthier replicas. However, due to an unrelated issue, there was a replication delay at the time of the incident, and failing over would have caused a greater impact on our customers.

Initially, we reported that GitHub Actions was affected, but we later determined that the impact was limited to jobs interacting with Packages services, while jobs that did not upload or download Packages remained unaffected.The incident occurred due to an error in newly introduced code, which caused containers to get into a bad state, ultimately leading to billing API calls failing with 503 errors. We mitigated the issue by rolling back the contributing change. In response to this incident, we are enhancing error handling, improving the resiliency of our billing API calls to minimize customer impact, and improving change rollout practices to catch these potential issues prior to deployment.",

On average, 26% of jobs requiring large runners had a >5min delay getting a runner assigned.  This was caused by the rollback of a configuration change and a latent bug in event processing, which was triggered by the mixed data shape that resulted from the rollback.  The processing would reprocess the same events unnecessarily and cause the background job that manages large runner creation and deletion to run out of resources.  It would automatically restart and continue processing, but the jobs were not able to keep up with production traffic.  We mitigated the impact by using a feature flag to bypass the problematic event processing logic.  While these changes had been rolling out in stages over the last few months and had been safely rolled back previously, an unrelated change prevented rollback from causing this problem in earlier stages.We are reviewing and updating the feature flags in this event processing workflow to ensure that we have high confidence in rollback in all rollout stages.  We are also improving observability of the event processing to reduce the time to diagnose and mitigate similar issues going forward.",

The cause of both these delays was an incident in East US 2 impacting provisioning and network connectivity of Azure resources.  More details on that incident are visible at https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status/history (Tracking ID: PLP3-1W8). Because these runners are reliant on private networking with networks in the East US 2 region, there were no immediate mitigations available other than restoring network connectivity.  Going forward, we will continue evaluating options to provide better resilience to 3rd party regional outages that affect private networking customers.",

During the incident, Actions workflows triggered by the on: pull_request trigger for the closed type were not queued successfully because of these missing merge commit SHAs. Approximately 45,000 repositories experienced these missing workflow triggers in either of two possible scenarios: pull requests which were closed, but not merged; and pull requests which were merged. Impact was mitigated after rolling back the aforementioned feature flag. Merged pull requests that were affected have had their merge commit SHAs restored. Closed pull requests have not had their merge commit SHA restored; however, customers can re-open and close them again to recalculate this SHA. We are investigating methods to improve detection of these kinds of errors in the future.",

The error rate was 8.5% on average and peaked at 44.3% of requests. The increased error rate caused a broad impact across our services, such as the inability to log in, view a repository, open a pull request, and comment on issues. The errors were caused by our web servers being overloaded as a result of planned maintenance that unintentionally caused our live updates service to fail to start. As a result of the live updates service being down, clients reconnected aggressively and overloaded our servers.We only marked Issues as affected during this incident despite the broad impact. This oversight was due to a gap in our alerting while our web servers were overloaded. The engineering team's focus on restoring functionality led us to not identify the broad scope of the impact to customers until the incident had already been mitigated.We mitigated the incident by rolling back the changes from the planned maintenance to the live updates service and scaling up the service to handle the influx of traffic from WebSocket clients.We are working to reduce the impact of the live updates service's availability on github.com to prevent issues like this one in the future. We are also working to improve our alerting to better detect the scope of impact from incidents like this.",

This led to an increase in overall load on a shared database cluster, resulting in a cascading effect on multiple services and specifically affecting repository access authorization checks. We mitigated the incident after rolling back the change at 19:07 UTC, fully recovering within 4 minutes. While this incident was caught and remedied quickly, we are implementing process improvements around recognizing and reducing risk of changes involving high volume authorization checks. We are investing in broad improvements to our safe rollout process, such as improving early detection mechanisms.",

The highest impact was for users who experienced errors while creating and commenting on Pull Requests and Issues. Actions had a 3.3% error rate in jobs and delays on some updates during this time.This was due to an erroneous database credential change impacting write access to Issues and Pull Requests data. We mitigated the incident by reverting the credential change at 19:52 UTC. We continued to monitor service recovery before resolving the incident at 20:05 UTC. There are a few improvements we are making in response to this. We are investing in safe guards to the change management process in order to prevent erroneous database credential changes. Additionally, the initial rollback attempt was unsuccessful which led to a longer time to mitigate. We were able to revert through an alternative method and are updating our playbooks to document this mitigation strategy.",

On average, 13.5% of all workflows requiring large runners over the incident time were affected, peaking at 46% of requests. Standard and Mac runners were not affected.Following the Dec 1 incident, we had disabled non-critical paths in the provisioning job and believed that would eliminate any impact while we understood and addressed the timeouts.  Unfortunately, the timeouts were a symptom of broader job health issues, so those changes did not prevent this second occurrence the following day.  We now understand that other jobs on these agents had issues that resulted in them hanging and consuming available job agent capacity.  The reduced capacity led to saturation of the remaining agents and significant performance degradation in the running jobs.In addition to the immediate improvements shared in the previous incident summary, we immediately initiated regular recycles of all agents in this area while we continue to address the issues in both the jobs themselves and the resiliency of the agents.  We also continue to improve our detection to ensure we are automatically detecting these delays.",

There were also lower levels of intermittent queuing on Dec 1 beginning around 3:00 UTC.  Standard and Mac runners were not affected. The job failures were caused by timeouts to a dependent service in the VM provisioning flow and gaps in the jobs’ resilience to those timeouts.  The incident was mitigated by circumventing the dependency as it was not in the critical path of VM provisioning.There are a few immediate improvements we are making in response to this.  We are addressing the causes of the failed calls to improve the availability of calls to that backend service.  Even with that impact, the critical flow of large VM provisioning should not have been impacted, so we are improving the client behavior to fail fast and circuit break non-critical calls.  Finally the alerting for this service was not adequate in this particular scenario to ensure fast response by our team.  We are improving our automated detection from this to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.",

Delays recovered once the Redis cluster connectivity was restored at 8:16 UTC. The incident was fully mitigated once the job queue had processed by 9:24 UTC. This incident followed an earlier short period of impact on hosted runners due to a similar issue, which was mitigated by failing over to a healthy cluster.From this, we are working to improve our observability across Redis clusters to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future where multiple clusters and services were impacted.

Attempts to recover the database led to cascading failures that impacted the DNS systems for that site. The team worked to restore the infrastructure and there was no customer impact until 17:31 UTC. During the incident, impact to the following services could be observed:- Copilot: Degradation in IDE code completions for 4% of active users during the incident from 17:31 UTC to 21:45 UTC.- Actions: Workflow runs delay (25% of runs delayed by over 5 minutes) and errors (1%) between 20:28 UTC and 21:30 UTC. Errors while creating Artifact Attestations.- Customer migrations: From 18:16 UTC to 23:12 UTC running migrations stopped and new ones were not able to start.- Support: support.github.com was unavailable from 19:28 UTC to 22:14 UTC. - Code search: 100% of queries failed between 2024-10-11 20:16 UTC and 2024-10-12 00:46 UTC.Starting at 18:05 UTC, engineering attempted to repoint the degraded site DNS to a different site to restore DNS functionality. At 18:26 UTC the test system had validated this approach and a progressive rollout to the affected hosts proceeded over the next hour. While this mitigation was effective at restoring connectivity within the site, it caused issues with connectivity from healthy sites back to the degraded site, and the team proceeded to plan out a different remediation effort.At 20:52 UTC, the team finalized a remediation plan and began the next phase of mitigation by deploying temporary DNS resolution capabilities to the degraded site. At 21:46 UTC, DNS resolution in the degraded site began to recover and was fully healthy at 22:16 UTC. Lingering issues with code search were resolved at 01:11 UTC on October 12.The team continued to restore the original functionality within the site after public service functionality was restored. GitHub is working to harden our resiliency and automation processes around this infrastructure to make diagnosing and resolving issues like this faster in the future.",

Additionally, there was no impact to customers in other regions.The cause was traced to storage capacity constraints in the region and was mitigated by temporarily redirecting create requests to other regions. Afterwards, additional storage capacity was added to the region and traffic was routed back. A bug was also identified that caused some available capacity to not be utilized, artificially constraining capacity and halting creations in the region prematurely. We have since fixed this bug as well, so that available capacity scales as expected according to our capacity planning projections.",

At 05:24 UTC, we implemented a mitigation to shift traffic to healthy infrastructure and new Actions Runs resumed normal operations. During the rest of the incident window, Actions runs started before 05:24 UTC continued to see delays publishing logs or job results.  No Actions runs or Webhook deliveries were lost, only delayed.We mitigated the incident by immediately shifting traffic to a healthy cluster while investigating. The incident was caused by an erroneous configuration change on our eventing platform. A permanent fix was deployed at 06:22 UTC after which services began to recover and burn down their backed up queues, with full recovery by 07:13 UTC.We are working to reduce our time to detection and develop test automation to prevent issues like this one in the future.",

Previously enabled GitHub Connect GHES instances were not impacted by this issue.Customers experiencing this issue would have received a 404 response during GitHub Connect enablement and subsequent messages about a failure to connect. This was due to a recent change in configuration to GitHub Connect which has since been rolled back. Subsequent enablement failures on re-attempts were caused by data corruption which has been remediated.

The issue stemmed from a backlog of Pull Request events which caused delays in Actions processing the event queues that trigger workflow runs.We mitigated the incident by disabling the process that led to the sudden spike in Pull Request events.

This was due to a configuration change that impacted traffic routing within our database infrastructure, resulting in critical services unexpectedly losing database connectivity. There was no data loss or corruption during this incident. At 22:59 UTC an erroneous configuration change rolled out to all GitHub.com databases that impacted the ability of the database to respond to health check pings from the routing service. As a result, the routing service could not detect healthy databases to route application traffic to. This led to widespread impact on GitHub.com starting at 23:02 UTC. We mitigated the incident by reverting the change and confirming restored connectivity to our databases. At 23:38 UTC, traffic resumed and all services recovered to full health. Out of an abundance of caution, we continued to monitor before resolving the incident at 00:30 UTC on August 15th, 2024. To prevent recurrence we are implementing additional guardrails in our database change management process. We are also prioritizing several repair items such as faster rollback functionality and more resilience to dependency failures. Given the severity of this incident, follow-up items are the highest priority work for teams at this time.",

Many pages were impacted by this failure due to a lack of resiliency to the timeouts.We mitigated the incident by reverting the rollout of the caching layer 11 minutes after initial detection.

Team creation and team edits would appear to function as normal, but the selected group would not be linked to the team after form submission.

Users were also not able to enable Actions or register self-hosted runners. This was caused by an unreachable backend resource in the Central US region. That resource is configured for geo-replication, but the replication configuration prevented resiliency when one region was unavailable. Updating the replication configuration mitigated the impact by allowing successful requests while one region was unavailable. By July 19 00:12 UTC, users saw some improvement in Actions jobs and full recovery of Pages. Standard hosted runners and self-hosted Actions workflows were healthy by 2:10 UTC and large hosted runners fully recovered at 2:38.Copilot requests were also impacted with up to 2% of Copilot Chat requests and 0.5% of Copilot Completions requests resulting in errors. Chat requests were routed to other regions after 20 minutes while Completions requests took 45 minutes to reroute. We have identified improvements to detection to reduce the time to engage all impacted on-call teams and improvements to our replication configuration and failover workflows to be more resilient to unhealthy dependencies and reduce our time to failover and mitigate customer impact.",

We partially resolved the incident by aborting the testing event at 16:17 UTC and fully resolved the incident by rolling back the network configuration changes at 16:49 UTC. We have paused all planned capacity expansion activity within GitHub data centers until we have stabilized the root cause of this incident. In addition, we are reexamining our load testing practices so they can be done in a safer environment and making architectural changes to the feature that caused issues.",

Between 01:00 and 02:00 UTC we were able to reroute traffic for Chat to bring error rates below 6%. During the time of impact customers would have seen delayed responses, errors, or timeouts during requests. GitHub code scanning autofix jobs were also delayed during this incident. A resource cleanup job was scheduled by Azure OpenAI (AOAI) service early July 13th targeting a resource group thought to only contain unused resources. This resource group unintentionally contained critical, still in use, resources that were then removed. The cleanup job was halted before removing all resources in the resource group. Enough resources remained that GitHub was able to mitigate while resources were reconstructed.We are working with AOAI to ensure mitigation is in place to prevent future impact. In addition, we will improve traffic rerouting processes to reduce time to mitigate in the future.",

On average, delivery delays were 24 minutes, with a maximum of 71 minutes. This was caused by a configuration change to the Webhooks service, which led to unauthenticated requests sent to the background job cluster. The configuration error was repaired and re-deploying the service solved the issue. However, this created a thundering herd effect which overloaded the background job queue cluster which put its API layer at max capacity, resulting in timeouts for other job clients, which presented as increased latency for API calls.Shortly after resolving the authentication misconfiguration, we had a separate issue in the background job processing service where health probes were failing, leading to reduced capacity in the background job API layer which magnified the effects of the thundering herd. From 18:21 UTC to 21:14 UTC, Actions runs on PRs experienced approximately 2 minutes delay and maximum of 12 minutes delay. A deployment of the background job processing service remediated the issue.To reduce our time to detection, we have streamlined our dashboards and added alerting for this specific runtime behavior. Additionally, we are working to reduce the blast radius of background job incidents through better workload isolation.",

Approximately 25% of all runs targeting larger hosted runners queued during this time were slow to start, with a median wait time of 1 minute, 55 seconds.The issue was caused by a downstream dependency overloading, which impacted our machine setup process. Each larger hosted runner job is run on a fresh VM, and one of the setup steps is installing the Actions agent. Up to the point of this incident, we would pull the latest agent version from the GitHub release and install it on the VM. However, during this incident the speciific GitHub release for the Linux x64 Actions agent became overloaded, and our agent downloads were severely throttled. This throttling led to timeouts during the download, and caused our hosted runner system to conclude the VMs were failing to start. We need the Actions agent online to start serving jobs, and with the download timing out, our service assumed the runner wasn't starting up successfully. This failure to start up led to those VMs being reset again and again instead of serving jobs. We mitigated the issue by falling back to a cached version of the Actions agent present on our image.We have further refined the fallback system to automatically use the cached agent binaries, and added new functionality to allow for easier agent downloading from other locations. Both of these measures should eliminate future impacts from similar downstream impact.",

The problem was identified, and a status update was provided shortly after. A mitigation strategy was implemented by 14:30 UTC, which mitigated the impact.The root cause of the incident was a combination of issues in the request handling process. Specifically, some requests were malformed, which resulted in being incorrectly routed to the wrong deployment. That deployment wasn’t resilient to the malformed requests and resulted in errors.To mitigate the immediate impact, requests were routed away from the failing deployment. This temporarily reduced the number of errors while the underlying issue was investigated and resolved.To prevent similar incidents in the future, we have enhanced validation checks for incoming requests to ensure proper handling and routing. In addition, we upgraded backend systems to provide more robust error handling and observability.",

During the incident, the 75th percentile time to merge a pull request went from around 3 seconds to just over 6 minutes. We also saw slightly elevated error rates across the service, with an average error rate of 0.1%, peaking to 0.31% of requests. The underlying cause of the incident was a repeated problematic query that resulted in MySQL replicas crashing, which caused a back-up in the jobs that compute whether PRs can be merged.At 16:30 the incident self-mitigated when the volume of the problematic query decreased. Concurrent to this, we deployed a mitigation to remove the mergability polling code from the PR experience to alleviate pressure on MySQL servers. This mitigation caused the merge button to not automatically enable, but require a page refresh instead. At 17:40 we statused PRs again for this issue. We rolled back the mitigation to resolve the second incident at 18:20.Going forward, to improve mitigation we are investing in faster recovery from cascading read-replica crashes, improving query retry logic to more aggressively back off when read replicas are unhealthy, improving our ability to diagnose server crashes and trace them back to user activity, and making it easier to block problematic queries.To prevent recurrence, we are eliminating the query that caused the server to crash, improving our detection and mitigation of problematic queries, and investigating and remediating the underlying issues that caused MySQL to crash. We are also improving the merge button polling mechanism and mergeability background job to be resilient to this class of incident so customers can still merge PRs.",

At 14:21 UTC on April 14th, community reports of this were confirmed and an incident declared. Emails most impacted by the delay were password reset and unrecognized device verification, which contain time-sensitive links or verification codes, and are required to be acted on in order for password resets or unrecognized logins to proceed. Users attempting to reset their password during the incident were unable to complete the reset. Users without two-factor authentication (2FA), signing in on an unrecognized device, were unable to complete device verification. Enterprise Managed Users, users with 2FA, and users on recognized devices or IP addresses were still able to sign in. This impacted 800-1000 user device verifications and 300-400 password resets. The mailer delays were caused by increased usage of a shared resource pool; a separate internal job queue became unhealthy and prevented the mailer queue from being worked on. We have made some immediate improvements to better detect and react to this type of situation again. As a short-term mitigation strategy, we have added a queue-bypass ability for  time-sensitive emails, like password reset and unrecognized device verification. We can enable this setting if we observe email delays reoccurring, which will ensure that future incidents do not affect user ability to complete critical login flows. We have paused the unhealthy job queue, to prevent impact to other queues using shared resources. And we have updated our methods of detection for anomalous email delivery, to identify this issue sooner.",

GitHub Actions saw delays and failures across the entire run life cycle and had a significant increase in the number of  timeouts in API requests. All Pages deployments failed for the duration of the incident. Git Systems saw approximately 12% of raw file download requests and 16% of repository archive download requests return HTTP 50X error codes for the duration of the incident. Issues experienced increased latency for issue creation and updates. Codespaces saw roughly 500 requests to create and resume a Codespace timeout during the incident.We mitigated the incident by rolling back the offending query. We are working to introduce measures to automatically detect compute-intensive queries in test runs during CI to prevent an issue like this one from recurring.",

In response to this incident, we are also working to make performance improvements to the class of queries that most frequently resulted in failed requests during this timeframe.Web-based repository file editing saw a 17% failure rate during the incident with other repository management operations (e.g. rule updates, web-based branch creation, repository renames) seeing failure rates between 1.5% and 8%. API failure rates for these operations were higher.Issue and Pull Request authoring was heavily impacted during this incident due to reliance on the impacted database primary. We are continuing work to remove our dependence on this particular primary instance from our authoring workflows for these services.GitHub search saw a 5% failure rate throughout this incident due to reliance on the impacted primary database when authorizing repository access. The majority of failing requests were for search bar autocomplete with a limited number of search result failures as well.",

Additionally, 0.15% of Webhook deliveries were degraded due to an unrelated spike in database latency in a single availability zone. SLOs for Actions were 90% during the incident, but this was not evenly distributed across customers. We statused green after a long stretch of recovered SLOs, starting at April 4th, 2024 00:35 UTC. During this incident, we also had issues with incident tooling (https://www.githubstatus.com/) failing to update the public status page and occasionally not loading.The incident was resolved after the infrastructure issue was mitigated at 2024-04-04 04:27 UTC.We are working to improve monitoring and processes in response to this incident. We are investigating how we can improve resilience and our communication with our infrastructure provider, and how we can better handle ongoing incidents that are no longer impacting SLOs. We are also improving our incident tooling to ensure that the public status page is updated in a timely manner.",

New GitHub Codespaces could not be created, as were Codespaces sessions that required minting a new auth token.Actions saw delays and infrastructure failures due to the upstream dependency on fetching tokens for the repository for runs to successfully execute. GitHub Pages were affected due to the impact on Actions, resulting in 1266 page builds failing, which at the low point represented 33% of page builds failing. This resulted in page edits not being reflected on those impacted sites.We deployed an application update that included a newer version of our database query builder. The new version uses a newer MySQL syntax for upsert queries that is not supported by the database proxy service we use for some of our production-environment database clusters. This incompatibility impacted the permissions cluster specifically, causing requests that attempted such queries to fail.We responded by rolling back the deployment, restoring the previous query use, and thus mitigated the incident.We have identified and corrected a misconfiguration of the permissions cluster in our development and CI environments that will ensure queries utilize the proxy service to prevent future syntax additions causing issues in production.",

During this incident, the following customer impacts occurred: API error rates as high as 1%, Copilot error rates as high as 17%, and Secret Scanning and 2FA using GitHub Mobile error rates as high as 100% followed by a drop in error rates to 30% starting at 22:55 UTC. This elevated error rate was due to a degradation of our centralized authentication service upon which many other services depend.The issue was caused by a deployment of network related configuration that was inadvertently applied to the incorrect environment. This error was detected within 4 minutes and a rollback was initiated. While error rates began dropping quickly at 22:55 UTC, the rollback failed in one of our data centers, leading to a longer recovery time. At this point, many failed requests succeeded upon retrying. This failure was due to an unrelated issue that had occurred earlier in the day where the datastore for our configuration service was polluted in a way that required manual intervention. The bad data in the configuration service caused the rollback in this one datacenter to fail. A manual removal of the incorrect data allowed the full rollback to complete at 00:48 UTC thereby restoring full access to services. We understand how the corrupt data was deployed and continue to investigate why the specific data caused the subsequent deployments to fail.We are working on various measures to ensure safety of this kind of configuration change, faster detection of the problem via better monitoring of the related subsystems, and improvements to the robustness of our underlying configuration system including prevention and automatic cleanup of polluted records such that we can automatically recover from this kind of data issue in the future.",

Approximately 3.7% of runs queued during this time were unable to start.The issue was partially caused by a deployment of an internal system Actions relies on to process workflow run events. The pausing of the queue processing during this deployment for about 3 minutes caused a spike in queued workflow runs. When this queue began to be processed, the high number of queued workflows overwhelmed a secret-initialization component of the workflow invocation system. The errors generated by this overwhelmed system ultimately delayed workflow invocation. Through our alerting system, we received initial indications of an issue at approximately 18:44 UTC. However, we did not initially see impact on our run start delays and run queuing availability metrics until approximately 18:52 UTC. As the large queue of workflow run events burned down, we saw recovery in our key customer impact measures by 19:11 UTC, but waited to declare the incident resolved at 19:22 UTC while verifying there was no further customer impact.We are working on various measures to reduce spikes in queue build up during deployments of our queueing system, and have scaled up the workers which handle secret generation and storage during the workflow invocation process.",

No data or jobs were lost.  From 14:17 to 14:41 UTC, there was a partial degradation, where customers would experience intermittent delays with PRs and Actions.  From 14:41 to 15:24 UTC, 36% of PRs users saw stale data, and 100% of in progress Actions workflows did not see updates , even though the workflows were succeeding.  At 15:24 UTC, we mitigated the incident by redeploying our service and jobs began to burn down, with full job catchup by 15:54 UTC. This was due to under provisioned memory and lack of memory based back pressure in the service, which overwhelmed consumers and led to OutOfMemory crashes.We have adjusted memory configurations to prevent this problem, and are analyzing and adjusting our alert sensitivity to reduce our time to detection of issues like this one in the future.",

During this incident, the following customer impacts occurred: 50% of webhooks experienced delays of up to 5m, 1% of webhooks experienced delays of 17m at peak; Actions: on average, 7% of customers experienced delays, with a peak of 44%; and many Issues saw a delay in appearing in searches. At 9:32 UTC our automated failover successfully routed traffic to a secondary cluster. But an improper restoration to primary at 10:32 UTC caused a significant increase in queued jobs until 11:21 UTC, when a correction was made and healthy services began burning down the backlog until full resolution.We have made improvements to the automation and reliability of our fallback process to prevent recurrence. We also have larger work already in progress to improve the overall reliability of our job processing platform.",

While our IP Allow List functionality was developed with IPv6 in mind, it wasn't developed to handle these mapped addresses, and hence started blocking requests as it deemed these to be not in the defined list of allowed addresses. Request error rates peaked at 0.23% of all requests.We have so far identified three remediation items here:- Update the IP Allow List functionality to handle IPv4-mapped addresses.- Audit the rest of our stack to confirm there are no further places this IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses flaw exists.- Improve our testing and monitoring processes to better catch these issues in the future.",

However, errors gradually expanded across all regions we deploy to and led to our available compute capacity being exhausted.During the incident, up to 35% of Actions jobs using Larger Runners and 2% of Actions jobs using GitHub Hosted Runners overall may have experienced intermittent delays in starting. Once the issue was resolved by our cloud service provider, our systems made a full recovery without intervention.We’re working closely with our service provider to understand the cause of the outage and mitigations we can put in place. We’re also working to increase our resilience to outages of this nature by expanding the regions we deploy to beyond the existing set, especially for Larger Runners.",

This led to a sustained period of timed out requests across a number of services, including but not limited to our git backend.  An average of 5% and max of 10% of requests failed with a 5xx response or timed out during this period.  This was caused by a combination of events that led to connection limits being hit in load balancer proxies in that site.  An upgrade of hosts was in flight, which meant a subset of proxy hosts were draining and coming offline as the upgrade rolled through the fleet.  A config change event also triggered a connection reset across all services in that site.  These events are commonplace, but led to a spike in connection establishment events that led to the online proxy hosts hitting the connection limit.  Upon further analysis, that limit was lower than it should have been.  We have increased that limit to prevent this from recurring.  We have also identified improvements to our monitoring of connection limits and behavior and changes to reduce the risk of proxy host upgrades leading to reduced capacity.",

Unfortunately, the outage prevented the generation of links for managing email subscriptions, resulting in the `/settings/emails` page timing out. Consequently, customers were unable to update their email subscription preferences during this period.During the incident we implemented graceful degradation on the `/settings/email` page to enable certain functionality, albeit with slower response times. By approximately 16:15 UTC on January 3rd, our contact permissions system was fully operational again, and customers could manage their email subscription preferences as usual.With the issue now resolved, our team is enhancing the `/settings/emails` page  resilience to minimize the impact of system outages in the future. This includes better request timeout handling and improved metrics and monitoring in this area of the application.",

The majority of impact was mitigated at 22:10, with a lower rate of failures ending by 22:50. This issue was caused by unhandled exceptions during routine maintenance of our internal networking hosts. Hosts that were thought to be no longer serving traffic were removed from service which led to the initial errors. Recovery took longer than expected because of issues in our automated recovery tooling. As a result, manual intervention was performed to remove the unhealthy hosts and requests returned to normal. The bug in the automated recovery tooling has been fixed and we’ve made changes to prevent unintended removal of hosts that are serving traffic.",

An interaction between two feature flag rollouts caused us to suppress delivery of push webhooks between 16:23 and 17:11 UTC in a manner that evaded our existing observability. This affected 71,000 repositories whose users will have noted missing webhook deliveries and/or experienced Actions jobs with push triggers failing to start. During this period, around 25% of new Actions jobs were impacted. The issues were resolved by disabling one of the feature flags in question.After weighing various options for retroactively dispatching old push webhooks, we concluded that the risk of delivering stale data to customers with these redeliveries outweighed the possible benefit.As follow up to this incident, we are working to improve monitoring of webhook throughput and to document a policy around webhook redelivery timelines.",

Due to an error in the certificate formatting, we uploaded an invalid certificate configuration that was not observed in our pre-production testing. Our background job servers were unable to start because a valid configuration is required at worker start up. As a result, users experienced delays in Pull Requests, Webhooks, Issues, Actions and Projects. Rollback of the change was slowed by the invalid certificate as our deployment system relied on the same certificate. Rollback was completed at 20:35 UTC. Most services recovered by 20:44 UTC. Delayed updates to Issues and Pull Requests were applied normally once the changes were rolled back. After the change was rolled back, a large queue of Actions-related jobs built up which included Pull Request, Pull Request review and Pull Request review comment events. About 2.3% of Actions jobs failed during the duration of the incident. Job queue times returned to normal once all remaining jobs were processed.We are working to improve our certificate testing and rotation process to reduce the risk of customer-impacting errors.",

During this time window 100% of Actions jobs were delayed in starting for up to 11 minutes.Unfortunately, the rapid queue recovery sent a thundering herd of jobs to Actions hosted runner pools, causing a database deadlock that resulted in some hosted runner pools having increased latency when accepting new jobs.

This delay affected various services utilizing background jobs, including Actions, Webhooks, Pull Requests, and Pages. The impact persisted for approximately one hour until 2:10 UTC.During the incident, some customers experienced delays in starting Github Actions workflow runs and Pages builds. We estimate that about 10% of Actions workflow runs were delayed during the impact window and 99% of Pages builds failed from 1:00 UTC to 1:20 UTC. Users may have experienced a delay in seeing recent pushes reflected in pull request views. This delay averaged between 5 and 10 minutes and affected up to 30% of pull request page views during the incident. 1% of pull request page views experienced delays of up to 60 minutes. Finally, 30% of webhook deliveries in this window missed our target of being delivered within 1 minute of the triggering event.This incident was caused by excessive rebalancing in our Kafka consumer group that feeds our background job system. We have altered our Kafka configuration to reduce the likelihood of this issue, created diagnostic tools to identify future causes, and will be breaking up this relay into multiple groups to limit the blast radius if the problem does reoccur.",

        "body": "A performance and resilience optimization to the authorization microservice contained a memory leak that was exposed under high traffic. This resulted in a number of pages returning 404’s that should not have. Testing the build in our canary ring did not expose the service to sufficient traffic to discover the leak, allowing it to graduate to production at 6:37 PM UTC.  The memory leak under high load caused pods to crash repeatedly starting at 6:42 PM UTC, failing authorization checks. These failures triggered alerts at 6:44 PM UTC. Rolling back the authorization service change was delayed as parts of the deployment infrastructure relied on the authorization service and required manual intervention to complete. Rollback completed at 7:08 PM UTC and all impacted GitHub features recovered after pods came back online.  We are evaluating changes to our rollout strategy to better detect this sooner and with less impact, changes to remove the dependency between authorization services and deployment rollback, and incident response improvements to reduce the overall time to recover.This incident is unrelated to the Slack integration incident.  The combined status updates are a limitation of our status reporting tooling and we recognize the confusion this creates. Work to address this was already in progress and will be complete this month.",

There were intermittent outages in multiple regions with a subset of Copilot users experiencing completion errors.

Under normal operating conditions, a series of asynchronous jobs runs in response to every push and within a few seconds applies a number of side-effects in Pull Requests such as requesting reviews, marking Pull Requests as merged, and showing new commits. During the incident, jobs were entering the queue faster than we could process them, resulting in processing delays as high as 75 seconds on average, and as much as 15 minutes in the worst case. About 10% of all Pull Request page loads were showing out-of-date data during this time.We had recently created a dedicated worker pool for processing these side-effects, with the goal of improving isolation between services and providing product teams with more direct control over critical parts of the system. We mitigated the incident by increasing capacity of the worker pool, which fully processed the backlog of delayed jobs, and returned everything to normal by 16:07 UTC. In response to this incident, we have adjusted our monitoring thresholds and improved our procedures for scaling up worker pools in response to increasing utilization.",

During the incident, some customers experienced delays in starting Github Actions workflow runs and receiving status updates for in-progress runs. The root cause was identified to be a change that was deployed to an internal distributed event streaming platform which resulted in several worker nodes to go over a misconfigured memory limit. This caused these nodes to restart leading to a reduced job processing throughput. Github Actions relies on events delivered through this event streaming platform to start workflow runs and update their status. Delays in receiving these events led to run delays for about 40% of the Actions workflows.\tWe mitigated this through a rollback of the offending change at 00:18 UTC. This allowed our event streaming platform to catch up with the backlog of workflow runs that were queued during the incident. The backlog was processed by 00:44 UTC. We have additional repair items in place to prevent a recurrence in the future.",

SAML login was affected, as was access to Actions, Issues, Pull Requests, Pages, API, Webhooks, Codespaces, and Packages. In this case, our automatic failover was unable to handle the partial file system failure mode. We mitigated by manually performing a forced failover, initiated 17 minutes after our first alert and completed 2 minutes later.With the incident mitigated, we are working to assess more detailed impact and resilience improvements to each impacted service while also improving the automated failover mechanism to support this scenario.",

This capability is typically used for larger CI/CD systems and bulk download of repository data.  This also caused intermittent periods of Actions workflow failures.During this incident we saw bursts of increased unique traffic on specific endpoints that overloaded our caching capability for this system. In addition, the traffic caused saturation of the service that exposed a bug in downloading archived files at high load which caused some archives to be downloaded with incomplete data. This caused intermittent failure of workflows for GitHub Actions, which primarily downloads actions data via these endpoints.We mitigated this through improvements to our rate limiting and changes to get to a healthy state across our backend service and cache . We initially relied on automated communication messages during this incident and will be working to ensure future incidents have more relevant status updates with specific customer impact.",

GitHub takes measures to ensure that we have redundancy in our system for various disaster scenarios. We have been working on building redundancy to an earlier single point of failure in our network architecture at a second Internet edge facility. This second Internet edge facility was completed in January and has been actively routing production traffic since then. Today we were performing a live failover test to validate that we could in fact use this second Internet edge facility if the primary were to fail. Unfortunately, during this failover we inadvertently caused a production outage.During the test we exposed that the secondary site had a network pathing configuration issue that prevented it from properly functioning as the primary facility. This caused issues with Internet connectivity to GitHub, ultimately resulting in an outage. We were immediately notified of the issue in our monitoring and alerting. Within two minutes of being alerted we reverted the change and brought the primary facility back online. Once online it took time for traffic to be rebalanced and for our border routers to reconverge restoring public connectivity to affected GitHub systems.This failover test helped expose the configuration issue, and we are addressing the gaps in both configuration and our failover testing which will help make GitHub more resilient. We recognize the severity of this outage and apologize for the impact it has to our customers.",

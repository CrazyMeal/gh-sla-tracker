Operations related to artifacts, cache, job steps and logs also had significantly increased latency. At peak, 67% of workflow jobs queued during that timeframe were impacted, and the median latency for impacted operations increased by up to 35x.This was caused by a significant change in load pattern on Actions Cache-related operations, leading to a saturated shared resource on the backend. The impact was mitigated by mitigating the new load pattern.To reduce the likelihood of a recurrence, we are improving rate-limiting measures in this area to ensure a more consistent experience for all customers.  We are also evaluating changes to reduce the scope of impact.",

We mitigated the incident by replacing the expired certificate and restarting impacted services. Once those services were restarted we saw a full recovery.We have updated our alerting to cover the expired certificate and are performing an audit of other certificates in this area to ensure they also have the proper alerting and automation before expiration.

A change to the notifications settings access path introduced additional load to the settings system, degrading its response times. This impacted both requests to web notifications (with p99 response times as high as 1.5s, while lower percentiles remained stable) and notification deliveries, which reached a peak delay of 24 minutes on average. System capacity was increased around 15:10 UTC and the problematic change was fully reverted soon after that, restoring the latency of web notifications and increasing notification delivery throughput, decreasing the delay in notification deliveries. The notification queue was fully emptied around 17:40 UTC.We are working to adjust capacity in the affected systems and to improve the time needed to address these capacity issues.",

On average the Codespace connection error rate was 90% and peaked at 100% across all regions throughout the incident period.- GitHub Actions larger hosted runners experienced degraded performance, with 0.5% of overall workflow runs and 9.8% of larger hosted runner jobs failing or not starting within 5 minutes.

There were approximately 100 requests during the incident that would have failed the download. Recovery began around 20:25 UTC.We were able to apply a number of mitigations to reduce impact over the course of the incident, but we did not achieve 100% recovery until our service provider’s incident was resolved.We are working to reduce critical path dependencies on the service provider and gracefully degrade experiences where possible so that we are more resilient to future dependency outages.",

The impact was limited to logged in users accessing repositories in organizations with more than 200,000 members. Forks of repositories from affected large organizations were also impacted. Git operations were functional throughout this period.This was caused by feature flagged changes impacting organization membership. The changes caused unintended timeouts for organization membership count evaluations which led to repository landing pages not loading.The flag was turned off and a fix addressing the timeouts was deployed, including additional optimizations to better support organizations of this size.

When the feature was partially rolled out it performed an excessive number of writes per request which caused excessive latency for writes from other API and Web endpoints and resulted in 5xx errors to customers. The issue was identified by our automatic alerting and reverted by turning down the percentage of traffic to the new feature, which led to recovery of the data cluster and services. We are working to improve the way we roll out new features like this and move the specific writes from this incident to a storage solution more suited to this type of activity. We have also optimized this particular feature to avoid its rollout from having future impact on other areas of the site. We are also investigating how we can even more quickly identify issues like this.",

XL and Intel runners recovered by 10:10 UTC, with the other types taking longer to recover.The degraded capacity was triggered by a scheduled event at 07:00 UTC that led to a permission failure on Mac runner hosts, blocking reimage operations.  The permission issue was resolved by 9:41 UTC, but the recovery of available runners took longer than expected due to a combination of backoff logic slowing backend operations and some hosts needing state resets.We deployed changes immediately following the incident to address the scheduled event and ensure that similar failures will not block critical operations in the future.

While many of the impacted instances self-recovered after mitigation efforts, approximately 2,000 codespaces remained stuck in a \"shutting down\" state while the team evaluated possible methods to recover unpushed data from the latest active session of affected codespaces. Unfortunately, recovery of that data was not possible. We unblocked shutdown of those codespaces, with all instances either shut down or available by 8:26 UTC on September 19.The disconnects were triggered by an exhaustion of resources in the network relay infrastructure in that region, but the lack of self-recovery was caused by an unhandled error impacting the local agent, which led to an unclean shutdown.We are improving the resilience of the local agent to disconnect events to ensure shutdown of codespaces is always clean without data loss.  We have also addressed the exhausted resources in the network relay and will be investing in improved detection and resilience to reduce the impact of similar events in the future.",

This was due a partial deployment of a feature flag to a global rate limiter. The flag triggered behavior that unintentionally rate limited all requests, resulting in 100% of them returning 403 errors. The issue was resolved by reverting the feature flag which resulted in immediate recovery.The root cause of the incident was from an undetected edge case in our rate limiting logic. The flag was meant to scale down rate limiting for a subset of users, but unintentionally put our rate limiting configuration into an invalid state.To prevent this from happening again, we have addressed the bug with our rate limiting. We are also adding additional monitors to detect anomalies in our traffic patterns, which will allow us to identify similar issues during future deployments. Furthermore, we are exploring ways to test our rate limit scaling in our internal environment to enhance our pre-production validation process.",

This backfill was completed at 21:25 UTC.After these repairs, about 98.5% of repositories were once again searchable. We are performing a full reconciliation of the search index and customers can expect to see records being updated and content becoming searchable for all repos again between now and Sept 25.NOTE: Users who notice missing or outdated repositories in search results can force reindexing by starring or un-starring the repository. Other repository actions such as adding topics, or updating the repository description, will also result in reindexing. In general, changes to searchable artifacts in GitHub will also update their respective search index in near-real time.User impact has been mitigated with the exception of the 1.5% of repos that are missing from the search index. The change responsible for the search issue has been reverted, and full reconciliation of the search index is underway, expected to complete by September 23. We have added additional checks to our indexing model to ensure this failure does not happen again. We are also investigating faster repair alternatives.To avoid resource contention and possible further issues we are currently not repairing repositories or organizations individually at this time. No repository data was lost, and other search types were not affected.",

On average, this impacted about 82% of users routed through one of our Middle East-based points-of-presence, which represents about 0.14% of global users.This was due to a configuration change within GitHub's edge infrastructure in the affected region, causing HTTP requests to fail.

At 21:15 UTC, we applied a fix to the production schema and by 21:17 UTC, all services had fully recovered.While repairs were in progress to avoid this situation, they were not completed quickly enough to prevent a second incident.

This was due to a sustained increase in unauthenticated repository traffic.We mitigated the incident by applying regional rate limiting, rolling back a service that was unable to scale with the additional traffic, and addressed a bug that impacted the caching of raw requests. Additionally, we horizontally scaled several dependencies of the service to appropriately handle the increase in traffic.We are working on improving our time to detection and have implemented controls to prevent similar incidents in future.",

After this period, traffic gradually recovered but error rate and latency remained slightly elevated until the end of the incident.This incident was triggered by a kernel bug that caused a crash of some of our load balancers during a scheduled process after a kernel upgrade. In order to mitigate the incident, we halted the roll out of our upgrades, and rolled back the impacted instances. We are working to make sure the kernel version is fully removed from our fleet. As a precaution, we temporarily paused the scheduled process to prevent any unintended use in the affected kernel. We also tuned our alerting so we can more quickly detect and mitigate future instances where we experience a sudden drop in load-balancing capacity.",

This incident was triggered due to a migration including an abnormally large number of repositories, overwhelming the queue and slowing processing for all migrations.We mitigated the incident by removing the problematic migrations from the queue. Service was restored to normal operation as the queue volume was reduced.To ensure system stability, we have introduced additional concurrency controls that limit the number of queued repositories per organization migration, helping to prevent similar incidents in the future.",

We mitigated the incident by routing cache download url requests to bypass the out-of-sync replica until it was fully restored.To prevent this class of incidents, we are developing capability in our database system to more robustly bypass out-of-sync replicas. We are also implementing improved monitoring to help us detect similar issues more quickly going forward.",

Approximately 57% of codespaces were affected during this incident, during which some customers may have observed incomplete or delayed billing usage information in their dashboards and usage reports, and may not have received timely notifications about approaching usage or spending limits. The incident was caused by an increase in the number of jobs in our worker pool without a corresponding increase in capacity, resulting in a backlog of unprocessed Codespaces billing jobs. We mitigated the issue by scaling up worker capacity, allowing the backlog to clear and billing data to catch up. We started seeing recovery immediately at 17:40 UTC and were fully caught up by 19:04 UTC.To prevent recurrence, we are moving critical billing jobs into a dedicated worker pool monitored by the Codespaces team, and are reviewing alerting thresholds to ensure more rapid detection and mitigation of delays in the future.",

This was caused by a misconfiguration in backend caching behavior after a failover, which led to duplicate job assignments and reduced available capacity. Approximately 19.7% of Ubuntu-24 hosted runner jobs on public repos were delayed.  Other hosted runners, self-hosted runners, and private repo workflows were unaffected.By 12:45 UTC, we mitigated the issue by redeploying backend components to reset state and scaling up available resources to more quickly work through the backlog of queued jobs. We are working to improve our deployment and failover resiliency and validation to reduce the likelihood of similar issues in the future.",

During the incident, 6% of all workflow runs couldn’t upload or download cache entries from the service, resulting in a non-blocking warning message in the logs and performance degradation. The disruption was caused by an infrastructure update related to the retirement of a legacy service, which unintentionally impacted Cache service availability. We resolved the incident by reverting the change and have since implemented a permanent fix to prevent recurrence.We are improving our configuration change processes by introducing additional end-to-end tests to cover the identified gaps, and implementing deployment pipeline improvements to reduce mitigation time for similar issues in the future.",

These were degraded at times, but peaked at 100% failure rates for some operations during this time.On May 23, a new feature was added to Copilot APIs and monitored during rollout but it was not tested at peak load. At 6:20 UTC on May 26, load increased on the code path in question and started to degrade a Copilot API because the caching for this endpoint and circuit breakers for high load were misconfigured.In addition, the traffic limiting meant to protect wider swaths of the GitHub API from queuing was not yet covering this endpoint, meaning it was able to overwhelm the capacity to serve traffic and cause request queuing.We were able to mitigate the incident by turning off the endpoint until the behavior could be reverted.We are already working on a quality of service strategy for API endpoints like this that will limit the impact of a broad incident and are rolling it out. We are also addressing the specific caching and circuit breaker misconfigurations for this endpoint, which would have reduced the time to mitigate this particular incident and the blast radius.",

Customers may have seen extended wait times for migrations to start or complete.This incident was initially observed as a slowdown in migration processing. During our investigation, we identified that a recent change aimed at improving API query performance caused an increase in load signals, which triggered migration throttling. As a result, the performance of migrations was negatively impacted, and overall migration duration increased. In parallel, we identified a race condition that caused a specific migration to be repeatedly re-queued, further straining system resources and contributing to a backlog of migration jobs, resulting in accumulated delays. No data was lost, and all migrations were ultimately processed successfully.We have reverted the feature flag associated with a query change and are working to improve system safeguards to help prevent similar race condition issues from occurring in the future.",

On average, the error rate for Gemini 2.5 Pro was 19.6% and peaked at 41%. This was due to a high volume of internal server errors and rate limiting by the upstream model provider.We mitigated the incident by temporarily disabling Gemini 2.5 Pro for all Copilot Chat experiences, and then worked with the model provider to ensure model health was sufficiently improved before re-enabling.We are working with partners to improve communication speed and are planning to move to more resilient infrastructure to mitigate issues like this one in the future.",

We’ve additionally updated rate limiting unauthenticated requests to reduce overall load, more details are here:  https://github.blog/changelog/2025-05-08-updated-rate-limits-for-unauthenticated-requests/",

The Pull Request synchronization process has automatic retries and most delays were automatically resolved. Any Pull Requests that were not resynchronized during this window were manually synchronized on Friday, April 11 at 14:23 UTC.This was due to a misconfigured GeoIP lookup file that our routine GitHub operations depended on and led to background job processing to fail.

This resulted in an increase in queue depth due to retries on failures to perform those jobs causing delays for non-migration sourced jobs.We declared an incident once we confirmed that this issue was not isolated to the problematic migration and other repositories were also failing to process ref updates. We mitigated the issue by stopping the migration and short circuiting the remaining jobs. Additionally, we increased the worker pool of this job to reduce the time required to recover.

The issue stemmed from connectivity problems between the Actions services and certain nodes within one of our Redis clusters. The service began recovering once connectivity to the Redis cluster was restored at 13:41 UTC. These connectivity issues are typically not a concern because we can fail over to healthier replicas. However, due to an unrelated issue, there was a replication delay at the time of the incident, and failing over would have caused a greater impact on our customers.

The connectivity issue self-resolved after 90 minutes.

Initially, we reported that GitHub Actions was affected, but we later determined that the impact was limited to jobs interacting with Packages services, while jobs that did not upload or download Packages remained unaffected.The incident occurred due to an error in newly introduced code, which caused containers to get into a bad state, ultimately leading to billing API calls failing with 503 errors. We mitigated the issue by rolling back the contributing change.

On average, 26% of jobs requiring large runners had a >5min delay getting a runner assigned.  This was caused by the rollback of a configuration change and a latent bug in event processing, which was triggered by the mixed data shape that resulted from the rollback.  The processing would reprocess the same events unnecessarily and cause the background job that manages large runner creation and deletion to run out of resources.  It would automatically restart and continue processing, but the jobs were not able to keep up with production traffic.  We mitigated the impact by using a feature flag to bypass the problematic event processing logic.  While these changes had been rolling out in stages over the last few months and had been safely rolled back previously, an unrelated change prevented rollback from causing this problem in earlier stages.We are reviewing and updating the feature flags in this event processing workflow to ensure that we have high confidence in rollback in all rollout stages.  We are also improving observability of the event processing to reduce the time to diagnose and mitigate similar issues going forward.",

There was also an earlier period of impact from 2025-01-08 22:00 UTC to 2025-01-09 4:10 UTC with 488 jobs impacted.  The cause of both these delays was an incident in East US 2 impacting provisioning and network connectivity of Azure resources.  More details on that incident are visible at https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status/history (Tracking ID: PLP3-1W8). Because these runners are reliant on private networking with networks in the East US 2 region, there were no immediate mitigations available other than restoring network connectivity.  Going forward, we will continue evaluating options to provide better resilience to 3rd party regional outages that affect private networking customers.",

During the incident, Actions workflows triggered by the on: pull_request trigger for the closed type were not queued successfully because of these missing merge commit SHAs. Approximately 45,000 repositories experienced these missing workflow triggers in either of two possible scenarios: pull requests which were closed, but not merged; and pull requests which were merged. Impact was mitigated after rolling back the aforementioned feature flag. Merged pull requests that were affected have had their merge commit SHAs restored. Closed pull requests have not had their merge commit SHA restored; however, customers can re-open and close them again to recalculate this SHA. We are investigating methods to improve detection of these kinds of errors in the future.",

The error rate was 8.5% on average and peaked at 44.3% of requests. The increased error rate caused a broad impact across our services, such as the inability to log in, view a repository, open a pull request, and comment on issues. The errors were caused by our web servers being overloaded as a result of planned maintenance that unintentionally caused our live updates service to fail to start. As a result of the live updates service being down, clients reconnected aggressively and overloaded our servers.We only marked Issues as affected during this incident despite the broad impact. This oversight was due to a gap in our alerting while our web servers were overloaded. The engineering team's focus on restoring functionality led us to not identify the broad scope of the impact to customers until the incident had already been mitigated.We mitigated the incident by rolling back the changes from the planned maintenance to the live updates service and scaling up the service to handle the influx of traffic from WebSocket clients.We are working to reduce the impact of the live updates service's availability on github.com to prevent issues like this one in the future. We are also working to improve our alerting to better detect the scope of impact from incidents like this.",

Web and API requests for Pull Requests experienced a 3.5% error rate and Issues had a 1.2% error rate. The highest impact was for users who experienced errors while creating and commenting on Pull Requests and Issues. Actions had a 3.3% error rate in jobs and delays on some updates during this time.This was due to an erroneous database credential change impacting write access to Issues and Pull Requests data. We mitigated the incident by reverting the credential change at 19:52 UTC. We continued to monitor service recovery before resolving the incident at 20:05 UTC. There are a few improvements we are making in response to this. We are investing in safe guards to the change management process in order to prevent erroneous database credential changes. Additionally, the initial rollback attempt was unsuccessful which led to a longer time to mitigate. We were able to revert through an alternative method and are updating our playbooks to document this mitigation strategy.",

On average, 13.5% of all workflows requiring large runners over the incident time were affected, peaking at 46% of requests. Standard and Mac runners were not affected.Following the Dec 1 incident, we had disabled non-critical paths in the provisioning job and believed that would eliminate any impact while we understood and addressed the timeouts.  Unfortunately, the timeouts were a symptom of broader job health issues, so those changes did not prevent this second occurrence the following day.  We now understand that other jobs on these agents had issues that resulted in them hanging and consuming available job agent capacity.  The reduced capacity led to saturation of the remaining agents and significant performance degradation in the running jobs.In addition to the immediate improvements shared in the previous incident summary, we immediately initiated regular recycles of all agents in this area while we continue to address the issues in both the jobs themselves and the resiliency of the agents.  We also continue to improve our detection to ensure we are automatically detecting these delays.",

There were also lower levels of intermittent queuing on Dec 1 beginning around 3:00 UTC.  Standard and Mac runners were not affected. The job failures were caused by timeouts to a dependent service in the VM provisioning flow and gaps in the jobs’ resilience to those timeouts.  The incident was mitigated by circumventing the dependency as it was not in the critical path of VM provisioning.There are a few immediate improvements we are making in response to this.  We are addressing the causes of the failed calls to improve the availability of calls to that backend service.  Even with that impact, the critical flow of large VM provisioning should not have been impacted, so we are improving the client behavior to fail fast and circuit break non-critical calls.  Finally the alerting for this service was not adequate in this particular scenario to ensure fast response by our team.  We are improving our automated detection from this to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.",

Delays recovered once the Redis cluster connectivity was restored at 8:16 UTC. The incident was fully mitigated once the job queue had processed by 9:24 UTC. This incident followed an earlier short period of impact on hosted runners due to a similar issue, which was mitigated by failing over to a healthy cluster.From this, we are working to improve our observability across Redis clusters to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future where multiple clusters and services were impacted.

Attempts to recover the database led to cascading failures that impacted the DNS systems for that site. The team worked to restore the infrastructure and there was no customer impact until 17:31 UTC. During the incident, impact to the following services could be observed:- Copilot: Degradation in IDE code completions for 4% of active users during the incident from 17:31 UTC to 21:45 UTC.- Actions: Workflow runs delay (25% of runs delayed by over 5 minutes) and errors (1%) between 20:28 UTC and 21:30 UTC. Errors while creating Artifact Attestations.- Customer migrations: From 18:16 UTC to 23:12 UTC running migrations stopped and new ones were not able to start.- Support: support.github.com was unavailable from 19:28 UTC to 22:14 UTC. - Code search: 100% of queries failed between 2024-10-11 20:16 UTC and 2024-10-12 00:46 UTC.Starting at 18:05 UTC, engineering attempted to repoint the degraded site DNS to a different site to restore DNS functionality. At 18:26 UTC the test system had validated this approach and a progressive rollout to the affected hosts proceeded over the next hour. While this mitigation was effective at restoring connectivity within the site, it caused issues with connectivity from healthy sites back to the degraded site, and the team proceeded to plan out a different remediation effort.At 20:52 UTC, the team finalized a remediation plan and began the next phase of mitigation by deploying temporary DNS resolution capabilities to the degraded site. At 21:46 UTC, DNS resolution in the degraded site began to recover and was fully healthy at 22:16 UTC. Lingering issues with code search were resolved at 01:11 UTC on October 12.The team continued to restore the original functionality within the site after public service functionality was restored.

Afterwards, additional storage capacity was added to the region and traffic was routed back. A bug was also identified that caused some available capacity to not be utilized, artificially constraining capacity and halting creations in the region prematurely. We have since fixed this bug as well, so that available capacity scales as expected according to our capacity planning projections.",

Approximately 1,100 runs were delayed long enough to get marked as abandoned. The runs that weren't abandoned completed successfully after we recovered from the incident. Actions jobs experienced average delays of 23 minutes, with some jobs experiencing delays as high as 45 minutes. During the course of the incident, 17% of runs were delayed by more than 5 minutes. At peak, as many as 80% of runs experienced delays exceeding 5 minutes. The root cause was a misconfiguration in the service that manages runner connections, which caused CPU throttling and led to a performance degradation in that service.We mitigated the incident by diverting runner connections away from the misconfigured nodes. We are working to improve our internal monitoring and alerting to reduce our time to detection and mitigation of issues like this one in the future.",

The overall SSH error rate during this period was 0.0005%, with a peak error rate of 0.3%.The root cause was traced to a regression in the service reload mechanism, which resulted in SSH hosts dropping connections on an hourly basis. As SSH hosts were rebooted for routine security updates, the issue progressively affected more hosts.To mitigate the impact, we removed the affected hosts from production traffic. The SSH regression has since been identified and resolved, with all SSH hosts fully restored. Additionally, we have implemented new monitoring to alert us of any SSH connection refusals moving forward.",

During the rest of the incident window, Actions runs started before 05:24 UTC continued to see delays publishing logs or job results.  No Actions runs or Webhook deliveries were lost, only delayed.We mitigated the incident by immediately shifting traffic to a healthy cluster while investigating. The incident was caused by an erroneous configuration change on our eventing platform. A permanent fix was deployed at 06:22 UTC after which services began to recover and burn down their backed up queues, with full recovery by 07:13 UTC.We are working to reduce our time to detection and develop test automation to prevent issues like this one in the future.",
